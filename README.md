<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I tried to do the whole process of converting a **strings.xml** into a spreadsheet in Google Sheets by hand and, even though you can do it with the option **Data > Split text to columns**, 
it involves wasting your time generating the spreadsheet manually instead of the more time-efficient solution of running a Python script to achieve that with any file format supported by the package

Moreover, not only this program can be executed on its own, it also can be installed as a package via **PyPI**.

The file types supported by the package are the following:
- XLSX
- ODS
- HTML
- CSV
- YAML
- JSON

<!-- PROJECT STRUCTURE -->

### Project Structure

Directories:

- `.github/workflows`: GitHub workflows.
- `examples`: Contains a few `strings.xml` files in case that you want to mess around with them.
- `src/android_strings_converter`:  Contains the source code files.

Besides those directories, there are also these files in the root (apart from the .gitignore, README.md and LICENSE):

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the names and versions of each package used to build this project. To install the requirements, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- `poetry.lock`: File generated by **Poetry**, a package manager for Python, that contains the exact versions of all packages used by a project. The file is used to ensure that all members of a development team are using the same versions of packages, even if different versions are available in the package repository.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Configuration file used by **pre-commit**, a tool that runs checks (such as linting, testing, or formatting) on the code before you commit changes to version control. The file specifies which checks pre-commit should run and how it should run them.
- `pyproject.toml`: Configuration file used by **Poetry**. It specifies the metadata for a Python project, including the project name, version, description, author, license and dependencies.


<!-- BUILT WITH -->

### Built With

- [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/): To generate ODS and XLSX files.
- [gspread](https://pypi.org/project/gspread/): To generate Google Spreadsheets.
- [protobuf](https://pypi.org/project/oauth2client/): Used by `google.oauth2.credentials` to authenticate to the user's Google account in order to create the spreadsheet, 
- [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/): To generate YAML files.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

If you want to execute the script:
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/android-strings-converter/releases) and download the latest one.

If you want to import the package into your project:
1. Run `pip install android-strings-converter`
2. Import the package with this line of code: `from android_strings_converter import <FUNCTION>`
- For example, if you were to import the `to_xlsx` function: `from android_strings_converter import to_xlsx`

If you want to open the code:
- Clone the project with the `git clone https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/android-strings-converter.git` command and then open it with your favourite IDE (mine is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)).

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

To execute the script, you can follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have the [latest version](https://github.com/HenestrosaConH/android-strings-converter/releases) of the script installed.
2. Open the command line and run the following command: 
    ```
    path/to/python path/to/main.py path/to/strings.xml -o path/to/strings.<FILE TYPE EXTENSION SUPPORTED>
    ```
    This will generate a file named `strings` in the desired path.  
    <br>

If you want to generate a Google Sheet, run the following command:
```
path/to/python path/to/main.py path/to/strings.xml -gs <SHEET NAME> -c path/to/service_account.json
```
Please note that you will have to generate the `service_account.json` yourself. To do it, you can do the following:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select an existing project.
3. Go to the **APIs & Services** page, click on **Dashboard** and then click on **Enable APIs and Services**.
4. Search for **Google Sheets API** and enable it.
5. Go to the **Credentials** page, click on **Create credentials**, and then choose **Service account**.
6. Give your service account a name and select a role. For this purpose, you can select **Project -> Editor**.
7. Click on the "Create key" button, select the JSON format and download the `service_account.json` file.
8. Share your Google Sheets file with the email address that is specified in the **client_email** field in the `service_account.json` file.

Alternatively, you can create an XLSX file and open it in Google Sheets if you don't want to go through the hassle of generating the `service_account.json` file.
